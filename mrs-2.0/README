Installation:

For a basic installation, run

        ./configure
        make
        make install

In addition, the documentation can be compiled with

        make doxygen-doc

If the required dependencies are located in places other than the default,
will you will need to specify their locations as arguments to the configure
script. For example:

	./configure CPPFLAGS='-I /usr/local/cxsc/include' \
                    LDFLAGS='-L /usr/local/cxsc/lib' \
	            --prefix='/home/user_name/mrs'

The file `custom_config.sh' can also be used, which contains a variation on the 
above command.  Make sure you export the environmet variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
properly (for example):
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cxsc/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
