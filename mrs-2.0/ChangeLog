MRS Release 2.0 ChangeLog
-----------------------------
MRS-2.0 has been substantially integrated across sub-pavings of Jaulin et al (2001) 
and the adaptive histogram objects of Sainudiin, Teng, Harlow and Tucker (2016) 
while still allowing C-XSC as well as capd libraries and tools to interoperate.

MRS Release 1.0 ChangeLog
-----------------------------
In the following we summarize the major changes to the MRS library
since release MRS 0.1.2-beta505 (released 30.04.2009):

** Introduced SPMinimalnode class, derived from SPnode, to use for
   reimplemention of the routines in
   "Applied Interval Analysis", by Jaulin, Kieffer, 
   Didrit and Walter; Springer, 2001.

** Considerable additional functionality for 
   adaptive histogram class (AdaptiveHistogram),
   including improvements to priority queue methods and introduction
   of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.

** Addition of a general type of mapped paving with arithmetic
   operations on mapped pavings defined.  Specialisations of 
   the general mapped paving type
   created for real-mapped pavings and interval-mapped pavings.

** Type to represent real-valued functions added 
   (PiecewiseConstantFunction).  Methods include marginalisation,
   creating conditional functions, integration, normalisation, and
   arithmetic on PiecewiseConstantFunctions.  Conversion of
   AdaptiveHistogram into a PiecewiseConstantFunction. 

** Types to create function estimates using function 
   interval enclosures or real-valued function approximations
   added.




MRS Release 0.1.2 ChangeLog
-----------------------------
In the following we summarize the major changes to the MRS library
since release MRS 0.1 (released 15.12.2005):

** Upgraded to latest autotools (libtool-2.2.6, autoconf-2.63, automake-1.10.2)

** Maintainance Release due to newer compiler versions

** Sub-pavings from "Applied Interval Analysis", by Jaulin, Kieffer, 
   Didrit and Walter; Springer, 2001 have been reimplemented in C-XSC with 
   a BUG in their Contains routine fixed (see BUGS/Contains.png)

** A more general class for sub-pavings added

** Various example targets added

** uniform and exponential priors in Moore rejegtion samplers

** Trans-dimensional Moore rejection samplers

** basic adaptive histograms based on sub-pavings
