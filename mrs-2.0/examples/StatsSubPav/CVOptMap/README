TO DO FOR Raaz:
Start from PointClous.cpp and make it specialized for one optimal density estimation.

The code for generating samples for piecewise constant approx can be found in:

mrs/trunk/examples/StatsSubPav/MCMC/MCMCFunctionSimGaussian.cpp - lines 93 to 178

The L1 errors calculation: getIAE() - line 229 
The getIAE function is defined in piecewise_constant_function.hpp
